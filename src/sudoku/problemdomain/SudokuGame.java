     * then a special UI screen will be displayed by the user interface.
     * To avoid Shared Mutable State (Shared change-able data), which causes many problems, I have decided to make this
     * class Immutable (meaning that once I created an instance of it, the values may only be read via getGameState()
     * and getGridState() functions, a.k.a. methods. Each time the gridState changes, a new SudokuGame object is created
     * by taking the old one, applying some functions to each, and generated a new one.
